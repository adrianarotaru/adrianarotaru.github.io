title: "The effects of Caloric restriction on the Biological Indices of Homeostasis"
collection: research
permalink: /paper/2016-02-16-caloric-restriction
excerpt: '  This paper studies the benefits of a caloric restrictive diet on preventing aging. In order to study the benefits of this type of diet, this paper compares the amount of antioxidants in the blood of rats under dietary restriction and in rats with normal diet. The results of the experiment can be used to explain how a dietary restriction can increase longevity. The findings might be useful in convincing people to adopt a new pattern in food consumption – reducing the daily amount of calories by 30 %, thus improving life quality.'
