EU parliament visit  My visit to the EU parliament, at the invitation of Siegfried Muresanu,  Vice-President of the European People’s Party Group, to discuss ways to improve representation of women in science and politics in the context of Moldova’s economic growth.	Article	EU-visit	EU Parliament Visit	2016-04-19	Brussels, Belgium	According a report released by the Moldovan National Bureau of Statistics, Women and girls occupy only 31% of jobs in the ICT sector in Moldova and only 19% of digital professions. In an effort to address this underrepresentation of women in technology via influencing policy, I have advocated for change of policy in Moldova at the EU Parliament in a dialogue with members of the parliament, the Moldovan organization LeaderSHE, and representatives and policy makers of the Moldovan government.
