2021-05-31	Embedded Dense Neural Networks for Battery Cyclability Prediction on Automotive Microcontroller Devices 	Harvard University Dash Office of Communication Directory	This paper explores the development of a testing methodology in the context of accurately predicting future battery performance using machine learning. In particular, I propose a Dense Neural Network Model that can predict battery life using data from the first 50 cycles in the battery life.	Rotaru, A. (2021).
