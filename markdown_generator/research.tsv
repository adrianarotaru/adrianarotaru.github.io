2021-05-31	Embedded Dense Neural Networks for Battery Cyclability Prediction on Automotive Microcontroller Devices 	Harvard Library Office for Scholarly Communication	This paper explores the development of a testing methodology in the context of accurately predicting future battery performance using machine learning. In particular, I propose a Dense Neural Network Model that can predict battery life using data from the first 50 cycles in the battery life.	Rotaru, A. (2021).

2016-02-16	The effects of Caloric restriction on the Biological Indices of Homeostasis	MoldSEF National Science and Engineering Fair IIIrd Prize	  This paper studies the benefits of a caloric restrictive diet on preventing aging. In order to study the benefits of this type of diet, this paper compares the amount of antioxidants in the blood of rats under dietary restriction and in rats with normal diet. The results of the experiment can be used to explain how a dietary restriction can increase longevity. The findings might be useful in convincing people to adopt a new pattern in food consumption â€“ reducing the daily amount of calories by 30 %, thus improving life quality.	Rotaru, A. (2021).
