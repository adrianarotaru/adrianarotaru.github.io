<p>Over the years, I have been involved in various conversations around feminism, technology, and meaning of life, in general. College has been, by far, the most mentally stimulating environment in my life, and during college, the cadence and scope of my conversations have enhanced significantly. Whether igniting a conversation on the chemical composition of eggshells over breakfast, or engaging in a morally loaded topic in class, it has all been about sharing and learning in college.  
</p>

<p> As I plunged into adult life after graduation, my Broca area – the part of the brain responsible for speech and articulation – entered a state of vegetation, where stimulating conversations are in acute deficit. I deeply yearn for sharing ideas and learning new things about the topics that interest me the most in this world: <b>technology and innovation, life and existence, identity and feminism</b>. 
</p>

<p>
  In this blog, I want to both share my learnings about the world, as broad and spurious as they might get, but also compartmentalize my thoughts and ideas in one place. Too often, I feel that ideas (mine, my friends’ or the world’s) are too precious to be ephemeral, and that time is too expensive to be wasted into intermittent thoughts that remain untraced.
