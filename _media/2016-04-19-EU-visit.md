According a report released by the Moldovan National Bureau of Statistics, Women and girls occupy only 31% of jobs in the ICT sector in Moldova and only 19% of digital professions. As an advocate for women representation in science and equal gender rights in Moldova, I have been invited by members of the EU Parliament to participate to the dialogue on policy making at the govermental level in Moldova that can support women pursuing careers in politics and science.
