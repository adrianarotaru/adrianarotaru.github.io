Me
======

I grew up in Moldova, a small country in Eastern Europe situated at the intersection of two cultures: conservative Russian and traditionalist, but slightly Westernized Romanian. To many people’s surprise, I speak Romanian, I watched Disney growing up, and, like many American teenagers, I was a big fan of The Wizards of Waverly Place, Phineas and Ferb and the Suite Life of Zack and Cody. Still, I was equally drawn to the intense and stoic nature of the Russian people, often indulging into Soviet war-themed movies, chanson and “blatnaya pesnya” music, or even cold plunges, fishing, mud baths, and the delicious pickled fish. 

As much as my lifestyle was influenced equally by the West and the East, so was my gender identity. The way gender inequality manifests itself in the East and West is very different.** *Note: the notion of the West and the East can be different for many people. In this post, the “East” will refer to Eastern Europe - where I grew up and studied - and  “The West” - to Western Europe and the US, where I lived as an adult, traveled, went to college and started a career.*

The East
======
It is widely accepted that the East is more patriarchal overall, and that it fosters a less friendly environment for women’s career growth. Although some of the general data on overall gender equality performance is in support of that view, more detailed data points to the opposite. According to data from *Our World in Data* in 2021, the gender inequality index was 0.20 in Moldova and Russia, 0.18 in the USA and 0.08 in France. The index is calculated based on metrics of reproductive health, empowerment and economic status. Moldova ranks just below the US in terms of overall gender equality, however, when looking at the specific metrics used to calculate the general index, it is no longer as clear. For example, Moldova has a 5.76% gender pay gap compared to 17.65% in the USA. In Moldova and all Eastern European countries (except for Poland), abortions are legal, whereas in many US states abortion is banned; Moldova has a woman president, but the US has never had one. Clearly, there are many other statistics to look at, but my intention is not to advocate for one side or the other. However, I would like to address precisely the nature of those differences. I will speak to my gender experience in both geographic bases and try to explain how these differences are reflected in my personal stories. The claims I will be making are about my social interactions as a young adult and professional dynamics as a young woman in science both in the East and the West. Call it empirical or anecdotal evidence, that will not undermine its evidentiary importance.  


In my early years in Moldova, I was an aspiring young scientist, competing in national and international competitions in Chemistry, Physics, and Biology. I have represented my country at the International Junior Science Olympiad in 2014 and at the International Chemistry Olympiad in 2016. From 2010 to 2016, I have been part of Moldova’s olympic team, have worked with university faculty and research scientists and have conducted research in cardiology at academic and clinical institutions in the country. Over the course of these years, I have grown to see the gender dynamics in diverse contexts, ranging from local scientific communities around people of my age, to high profile academic institutions and scientists of the international scientific community. Throughout these interactions, I have witnessed a wide range of reactions and sentiments towards the women’s involvement in science, from the admiration and adulation of their success, to frustration, tokenism, and undermining of women's success. 

However, what has been a major thread in my experience throughout, is the constant feeling of never being or doing ENOUGH. No matter how accomplished I or my female colleagues were, no matter how many medals we would bring home, no matter how much we would beat competition, there was always a **“yes, but”**. **YES**, you are incredibly smart, **YES** you are the only Moldovan person to have been admitted to Harvard that year, **YES**, you are the first qualified student at the National Selection, **BUT**, it is your male competitor who I invited to extra preparatory sessions for the upcoming olympiad. It is your male competitor that I sent to participate in that media interview. It is your male competitor that I invited to explain that problem to everyone else. I have confronted teachers over these matters many times and I never got a clear reasoning to the existence of “but”. One time, I went to my physics teacher to ask for an explanation as to why she did not put my name on the list for the physics olympiad in 8th grade, after I worked an entire year to prepare for it, and she just gave me a vague: “I did not think you were interested.” response.  Furthermore, my friend, Nicoleta, a silver medalist at the International Physics Olympiad, was constantly shamed by our physics teacher, with regards to her love life or looks. Because I was so dedicated to studying and was by nature an introvert, denoting a lack of interest in pursuing relationships with men, I was often asked whether I am a lesbian. 

The upfront insults, unapologetic rejections, or rather the overt lack of equitable appreciation generate anger and frustration, and, more importantly, combat.  Since misogyny in the East is pervasive, it is easier to acknowledge it, but also more conducive to justifiable counteroffensive. The Eastern European woman is tough. She is led into offense by a society that is so openly and unfairly offensive to her. She can rightfully become angry to unfairness and justify her aggressive actions, without being silenced, vilanized, or undermined for “overreacting”. And, even, if she is, her response matches the directness of the attack against her rights, hence justified. Although, fighting back misogynistic forces becomes draining, it is easier to battle direct rather than indirect misogyny - something that I realized years after moving to the US.

The West
======
In the West, sexism manifests itself differently. The discrimination is subtle, but at scale. You might not be told that your place is in the kitchen by a random dude, but you might be politely denied a fully deserved promotion that was granted to your male colleague. You might not be publicly humiliated for being overweight, but your male colleagues will never invite you to join them for a beer afterwork even if they enjoy your company, because you are not one of the 'bros'. In other words, discrimination, happens in grey areas of decision making and biased allocation and sharing of resources. It can be harder to prove, hence confront. That explains, partly, why my initial few months in the US were fabulous and liberating. It felt like I was finally in a society that seemed to treat me equally and to value my opinions as an equal human being. Then, I realized that the adversity is well below surface level. Putting up a good image is a prerequisite to being admitted in higher social ladder or to simply be accepted as an individual, so people would rather swallow their thoughts than put their social image at risk. The freedom of speech movement is so loud, yet so futile in its goal of liberating society. Condemning hate or discriminatory speech does nothing to people’s real views. The same views, if not expressed through direct speech, can be expressed through indirect actions. If there is anything the US has said loud and clear to me, it is: *actions speak louder than words. *
