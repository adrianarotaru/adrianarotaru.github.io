permalink: /project/2021-05-31-snoring-detection
excerpt: 'Snoring is related to a common medical condition that can lead to many serious health issues including diabetes, stroke, and depression. Due to the negative health impacts of such medical condition, it is crucial for people to know whether they snore and understand their snoring patterns and triggers of snoring. In this paper, we propose a bed-side snoring detection program on microcontroller device that automatically identifies snoring sounds.This paper explores the development of a testing methodology in the context of accurately predicting future battery performance using machine learning. In particular, I propose a Dense Neural Network Model that can predict battery life using data from the first 50 cycles in the battery life.'
